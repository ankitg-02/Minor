# TODO: Modify Data Ingestion and Processing for Last 20 Days and Date-Based Folders

## Steps to Complete:
1. **Modify data_ingestion/fetch_comments.py**: Update the ingestion pipeline to collect comments from videos published in the last 20 days (t-20 to t-1, where t is today). Add date filtering to the YouTube search API call.
2. **Update data_processing/preprocessing_pipeline.py**: Modify the save_processed_data function to create dedicated folders based on run timestamps (e.g., data/processed/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/) and save processed data inside these folders.
3. **Ensure automatic pipeline execution**: Verify that the run_ingestion_pipeline and run_preprocessing_pipeline functions work together, with ingestion collecting recent data and processing saving in new date-based folders each run.
4. **Test the updated ingestion and processing pipeline**: Run the full pipeline to ensure data is collected from the last 20 days and saved correctly in date-based folders.
